#### Algorithmic complexity:
In the hunt to out preform the brute force approach at solving this problem, I decided to use a Trie instead. In theory this should increase performance as the inputs scale because the program does not need to compare every possible case between the 2 inputs. While Iâ€™m sure there is a more efficient/slick/smart way to handle this, I believe this algorithm should do better than quadratic. Although it does require the need to occasionally create a second Trie with a subset of patterns (to handle a tie), it should still have time complexity of O(n).
